Revision history for Perl extension Class-Accessor-Constructor

0.06  Wed Oct  8 18:39:34 CEST 2008 (Marcel Gruenauer <marcel@cpan.org>)
     - Dropped support for SORT_CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS; slowed down things too much
       if called often, as it would be in large OOP apps.
     - Changed dist style and Changes back to standard. People didn't like it -
       the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.
     - Added standard test files; this will also help with CPANTS.
